## Problem Description
Andi is the owner of a large supermarket in one of the cities in Indonesia. Andi plans to improve the business process by creating a self-service cashier system in his supermarket with the hope that customers can directly input the items purchased, the quantity of items purchased, the item price, and other features. Customers who are not in the city can also purchase goods from the supermarket.

After conducting research, Andi realized that he has a problem, which is that he needs a programmer to create the necessary features to ensure the smooth operation of the self-service cashier system in his supermarket.

As a Software Engineer, my role would be to work closely with Andi to gather requirements for the self-service cashier program and understand his specific needs. I would then use my technical expertise to design and develop a software solution that meets these requirements, incorporating the necessary features that Andi requires for his supermarket.

## Requirement
To fulfill Andi's request, here are some objective I decided the program works:

### Technical requirement:
- Create self-service cashier program using Python language
- Connect the program to SQL database
- Use OOP and modularization to ensure the program's quality
- Apply PEP8 principles to write clean Python program

### Bussiness requirement:
- User could make a new transaction
- User could add, update, delete an item from cart and reset whole cart to empty transaction
- User could check what items on their cart
- User could check out their cart
- Implement discount for certain price threshold
